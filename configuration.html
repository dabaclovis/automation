THen build project using "mvn sonar:sonar" goal
NB:
For each language, sonar qube has provided on quality profile with set of rules

Quality profile means set of rules to perform code review

we can create our own quality profile base on requirement

create one quality profile

Name sbi_project
language java
parent none

NB* we can make our quality profile as default one wthen it will be applicable for all the projects which get reviewed
under this sonar server

NB* If we have any common ruleset for all projects then we can create one quality profile and we can use that as parent
quality profile for other projects

we can configure quality profile to specific project


-click on the project name
-administration
-click on quality profile
-select profile required

sonar qube
sonar qube is a continuous code quality checking tool
we can do code review using sonar qube


what is code coverage and code review in sonar qube

code coverage: How many lines of source code is tested by unit test cases
NB: industry standard code coverage is 80%

code review: Checking code convention

sonar qube is an open source software quality management toool
it will continuously analyzed and measure quality of the source code
it will generate code review report in html or pdf formate
it's a web base tool and support 29 programing languages
it support multiple OS platform
it support multiple databases(mysql, oracle, sql server, postgress sql...)

it supports multiple browsers

it will identify below category of issues in project source code

=>duplicate code
coding standard
unit test
code coverage
complex code
commented code
potential bugs


initially developed for java projects.



+++++++++++++++++++
quality gates


represent set of metric to identify project quality is passed or failed

every project quality gate should be passed
in sonar we have default quality gate
if required, we can create our own quality gate also


NB*i if project quality gate is failed then we should not accept that code for deployment
+++++++++++++++++++++++
if project is having sonar issues, then development team is responsible to fix those issues

as a devops engineer, we will perform code review and sent the code review report to the development
(url of sonar dashboard to development team)
